## Test your Anime Knowledge

## Problem 
Our challenge was to generate dynamic content to the page while also verifying correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions. 

## Approach 
My approach is always limit waste, meaning reduce any repeted references.
If the answer to a question is naruto, I don't want to have to write naruto again; I've already written it once, so why repeat myself.
Meaning I usually create objects or arrays so I can index and call to the values anytime, in populating the DOM or verifying user input.
